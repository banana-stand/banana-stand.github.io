<h3>13. INVESTMENT DECISIONS</h3>
<p>The following sub-paragraphs define the two types of investment decisions that can be made by this Partnership, the required quorum and majority needed to complete transactions during or apart from regularly scheduled meetings, and the rules for facilitating decisions apart from regularly scheduled meetings. (Commodities and options are not considered securities in the context of Article 13.)</p>
<ul>
<li>For investment decisions involving stocks, bonds and other securities during regularly scheduled meetings:
<ul>
<li>A committee of three shall be appointed monthly, by the President, and charged to review the portfolio and make sell recommendations it deems advisable, and also any purchase recommendations of new or existing investments, including the quantities of the purchases and/or sales.</li>
<li>A quorum consisting of fifty (50) percent of the partners must be present in person or by electronic means to conduct business.</li>
<li>The committee’s purchase recommendations regarding securities require a simple majority vote of the partners present at the meeting.</li>
<li>The committee’s sell recommendations regarding securities require a simple majority vote of partners present at the meeting.</li>
<li>All other investment decisions at regularly scheduled meetings (involving securities) not contained in the committee’s report shall require a two-thirds (2/3) majority of those present at the meeting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For investment decisions involving anything other than stocks, bonds or other securities:
<ul>
<li>For these Transactions, a quorum consisting of seventy-five (75) percent of the partners must be present in person or by electronic means to conduct business.</li>
<li>Any recommendation by the committee or from any member that involves the purchase or sale of anything other than stocks, bonds, or other securities shall require a three-quarters (3/4) vote of partners.</li>
<li>At the time of any new commitment recommendation of an item that is not currently in the portfolio and is not a security, the method of safekeeping and the method of pricing the item for valuation both for “valuation date” purposes and upon death or incapacity of a partner, shall be determined and voted upon as part of the recommendation, and shall be binding until changed by a vote of three-quarters (3/4) of those present at a subsequent meeting.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To facilitate investment decisions of either securities or non-securities outside of regularly scheduled meetings:
<ul>
<li>Any member can propose Transactions of new or existing investments, including the quantities of the purchases and/or sales.</li>
<li>A quorum consisting of personal or electronic acknowledgment from seventy-five (75) percent of the partners must be attained in order to conclude these Transactions.</li>
<li>Transactions outside of regularly scheduled meetings require three-quarters (3/4) majority of those participating in the quorum.</li>
<li>An Officer of the Partnership, or the President’s designate will preside over and keep track of voting on the Transaction.</li>
<li>Once a quorum is achieved, the Officer or designate in charge will determine if issues have had ample airing of member’s viewpoints before rendering the vote final.</li>
<li>To provide ample time for a quorum to develop, a maximum of seventy-two (72) hours will be allowed before a question quorum call is concluded and the decision or lack thereof is considered final. During this time, the members may lobby fellow members regarding the issues and/or to solicit the required quorum.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>18. WITHDRAWAL OF A PARTNER OR REDUCTION IN PARTNERSHIP INTEREST</h3>
<p>Any partner may voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership. He or she shall give written notice to the President or Treasurer and such withdrawal shall become effective on the valuation date following receipt of such written notice of withdrawal. The withdrawing partner shall be paid the full market value of his or her Partnership interest less the total costs incurred, if any, by reason of the withdrawal.</p>

<p>In cases of full or partial withdrawal, the other partners shall be given an option to purchase said interest at full market value within a period of thirty days after the valuation date following receipt of the notice, in which time the withdrawing partner must be paid.

Valuation of said interest, however, shall be as at the close of business on the date of death or legal incapacity, or the close of the business day preceding the date of death or legal incapacity if either occur on a non-business day.</p>
</div>
<div id="forbidden-acts" class="section level3">

<li>Without the approval of the Partnership, as set forth above, assign, transfer, pledge, mortgage or sell all or part of his interest in the Partnership to any other partner or other person, or enter into any agreement as the result of which any person not a partner shall become interested with him, or without him, in the partnership.</li>
